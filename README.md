# Project-X
Sure, here are the instructions on how to use the code to design the website:

   1. Create a new directory for your website.
   2. Clone the repository containing the code to the new directory.
   3. Install the dependencies by running the following command:


``
Code snippet
``
```
npm install
```


   4. Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your LeetCode API key to the file. The key should be in the following format:


``
Code snippet
``
```
REACT_APP_LEETCHODE_API_KEY=YOUR_LEETCHODE_API_KEY
```


   5. Start the development server by running the following command:


``
Code snippet
``

```
npm start
```


   6.  The website will be available at http://localhost:3000.

You can now design the website by editing the files in the src directory. The index.html file contains the main HTML for the website, and the App.js file contains the main JavaScript for the website. You can also add CSS to the website by editing the App.css file.

Once you have finished designing the website, you can deploy it to a web server. There are many different web servers to choose from, such as Apache and Nginx. You can also use a hosting service, such as HostGator or Bluehost.

I hope this helps!
